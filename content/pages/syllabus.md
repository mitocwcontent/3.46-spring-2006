Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Textbook
--------

The primary course text is:

Saleh, B. E. A., and M. C. Teich. _Fundamentals of Photonics_. New York, NY: Wiley, 1991. ISBN: 9780471839651.

Readings assigned from this book will be supplemented by lecture notes, selections from other books, journal articles, and other handouts.

Class Format
------------

Singapore-MIT Alliance (SMA) Workgroups
---------------------------------------

This class is offered concurrently to students at MIT and in Singapore via the Singapore-MIT Alliance. Students will assigned to Workgroups for weekly homeworks and Design Review projects. Each group will consist of 2-3 students at MIT and 2-3 students in Singapore.

Assignments
-----------

Students will be given weekly homework assignments. One solution will be submitted per workgroup. All members of the group receive the same homework grade.

Design Review Projects
----------------------

Workgroups must complete four design review projects during the term. These begin with an introduction and discussion during class, and proceed via Web site discussion forums and optional appointments with Prof. Kimerling. The final deliverables are:

*   20 minute presentation (5-6 slides), during which all workgroup members must speak.
*   Two days later, submit corrected slides and a final two-page report.

Weekly Quizzes
--------------

The weekly quizzes cover two lectures from the previous week. They test student attentiveness, and assess each student's ability to:

1.  Grasp Concepts, and
2.  Retain Facts.
